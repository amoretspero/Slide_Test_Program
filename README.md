Slide test program developed for course "Oriental Arts and Civilizations" at Seoul National University Spring 2015.

# Usage

git clone https://github.com/amoretspero/Slide_Test_Program

# Images
When you get the program, it need images to operate properly.

mail to amoretspero@snu.ac.kr and I will provide images.

# Make your own test
1. Get your courses PPT file.
2. Save each slides pictures as .jpg format. If multiple files are included in one slide page, save them as (slide number)-(image number).jpg
    EX : slide number 8 has 3 images => 8-1.jpg, 8-2.jpg, 8-3.jpg
3. Note that this program will support only THREE images per one slide page.
4. Move images to 'Images' folder (you have to create it.) and place that folder in directory same as 'Answers'.
    EX : when entering your program folder, you have to see
      1) Answers - Folder
      2) Images - Folder
      3) ConsoleApplication1 - Folder
5. Go to Answers folder and open answers.txt
6. Write answers to your pictures(=comments) in order that is same as PPT file you have.
    EX : answer of 4th slide should go to 4th line of answers.txt
7. Note that answers.txt should have only one answer per one line, and there should be no blank line at end or start.
Enjoy!
